#### Twitter Temperature Taker

This is a project I started, so I could play around with React, Redux and Socket.io.
After working with Redux and Socket in some contract work, I wanted to try and build
something by myself.
Working with Webpack was fun, and I am hoping to develop this very minimal version
that I have here to something more interesting.

Future me: To run this on your machine you will have to add those variables to your .env file (it is for the twitter API and the IBM Watson developer cloud config):<br/>
CONSUMER_KEY<br/>
CONSUMER_SECRET<br/>
ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY<br/>
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET<br/>
USERNAME<br/>
PASSWORD<br/>
VERSION<br/>
VERSION_DATE<br/>
NODE_ENV<br/>

`npm install`<br/>
`npm run dev`

For Deployment I used Heroku, don't forget to set all your environment variables on Heroku with:<br/>
`heorku config:set <key>=<value>`

<br/>
You are welcome, future me.
